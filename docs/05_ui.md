# User Interface (UI)

This document defines the **user interface behavior and presentation rules** for the
TimeTickIt application.

The UI is intentionally minimal and non-intrusive. It exists to reflect system state,
allow explicit user intent, and provide clear feedback. All logic and enforcement are
handled by the system core.

---

## UI Design Philosophy

The TimeTickIt UI follows these principles:

- Minimal and uncluttered
- Explicit rather than implicit
- Informational, not authoritative
- Non-surveillant and respectful
- Fully aligned with system rules

The UI must never guess intent, enforce policy, or override system behavior.

---

## Main Window Overview

TimeTickIt uses a **single main window**.

The main window presents:
- user identity (visual only),
- current system state,
- session timing information,
- inactivity feedback (when applicable),
- explicit control actions,
- output generation trigger.

No secondary dashboards, background windows, or hidden panels are permitted.

---

## User Identity Display

### Avatar

- A default avatar is displayed when the application starts.
- The avatar is **purely visual** and does not affect system behavior.
- Clicking the avatar cycles through a fixed set of built-in images in the following order:
  - `cat.png`
  - `dog.png`
  - `fox.png`
  - `panda.png`
- Avatar images are stored locally in:
  - assets/
- The selected avatar persists across application restarts.
- The avatar appears **only in the UI** and never appears in output files.
- No avatar upload or external image selection is supported.

---

### User Name

- The USER name is displayed in the main window.
- The USER name is editable through the UI.
- The USER name is used in generated output files (such as invoices and administrative records).

---

## System State Display

The UI must always reflect the **exact system state**.

### States

- **IDLE** — no active session exists.
- **ACTIVE** — exactly one session is currently active.

The UI must use these exact terms and must not replace them with alternative wording.

---

## Session Time Display

When the system is ACTIVE, the UI displays:

- SESSION START TIME
- elapsed SESSION TIME (continuously updated for display only)

Displayed time is informational and does not affect system calculations.

---

## Inactivity Feedback

User inactivity is monitored by the system core, not the UI.

### Display Rules

- Inactivity feedback appears **only when inactivity is detected** during an active session.
- The feedback is text-based and informational.

Example: "No activity detected — session will end in 01:42"


### Behavior

- Any mouse or keyboard input resets the inactivity timer automatically.
- The UI does not pause, extend, or override inactivity rules.
- The UI only reflects the current inactivity countdown.

---

## Session Controls

### Start Control

- Available only when the system is in the **IDLE** state.
- Explicitly initiates a new session.

### Stop Control

- Available only when the system is in the **ACTIVE** state.
- Explicitly ends the active session.

Controls must be enabled or disabled strictly based on system state.
No control may perform multiple actions.

---

## Auto-Ended Session Notification

When a session ends automatically due to maximum inactivity:

- The UI displays a **temporary inline notification**.
- The notification uses neutral, factual wording.

Example: "Session ended automatically due to inactivity."

- The message does not persist once acknowledged.
- No warning, penalty, or employer-related language is permitted.

---

## Output Generation

### Generate Output Control

- The UI provides a **Generate Output** button.
- This action is explicitly initiated by the USER.
- The UI prompts the USER to choose a save location.

Behavioral notes:
- Output generation does not start or stop sessions.
- Output generation does not modify session data.
- The UI does not send emails or transmit files.

All files are shared externally by the USER manually.

---

## Time Display (Clock)

The UI may display:
- the current system time, and
- the elapsed session time (when ACTIVE).

These displays are informational only.

---

## Layout Rules

- The UI uses a **flat layout**.
- Visual separation may be achieved using spacing or simple dividers.
- Card-based layouts, panels, or animations are intentionally avoided.
- The UI must remain visually lightweight and predictable.

---

## Accessibility and Tone

- Language must be neutral and respectful.
- No language implying surveillance or enforcement is allowed.
- UI messages must describe **what happened**, not **why the user behaved**.

---

## Explicit Non-Responsibilities

The UI must not:

- calculate billable time,
- modify inactivity thresholds,
- pause or resume sessions,
- auto-start sessions,
- expose administrative-only data,
- preview or modify output files,
- send emails or manage recipients.

All such responsibilities belong to the system core and output logic.

---

## Separation of Concerns

This document defines **presentation and interaction only**.

Behavioral rules are defined in:
- `03_system_core.md`

Terminology is defined in:
- `02_definition_of_terms.md`

Output behavior and visibility are defined in:
- `04_output.md`

---

## Guiding Principle

The UI exists to **show the truth of the system state** and allow explicit user action.

If a behavior is not clearly defined here, it must not exist in the UI.
