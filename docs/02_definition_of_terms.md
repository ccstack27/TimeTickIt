# Definition of Terms

This document defines the **authoritative terminology** used throughout the TimeTickIt project.

All terms defined here have **strict, enforceable meanings** and must be interpreted
consistently across documentation, code, tests, and generated outputs.

If a term appears elsewhere with informal wording, the definitions in this document
**always take precedence**.

---

## USER

The **USER** is the individual who operates the TimeTickIt application.

In the context of this project:
- the USER is always an **employee**
- the USER directly controls all actions within the application
- there is no concept of multiple users, roles, or permissions

The USER is the sole authority responsible for starting and stopping sessions.

---

## SESSION

A **SESSION** is a discrete, user-initiated time-tracking interval.

A SESSION:
- begins when the USER explicitly starts tracking,
- ends when the USER explicitly stops tracking or when the system ends it due to inactivity,
- represents a single, continuous period of recorded work.

Once a SESSION has ended, it is **immutable** and must not be modified.

---

## SESSION START TIME

**SESSION START TIME** is the exact timestamp at which a SESSION begins.

- It is recorded at the moment the USER starts a SESSION.
- It represents a point in time, not a duration.

---

## SESSION END TIME

**SESSION END TIME** is the exact timestamp at which a SESSION ends.

- It is recorded when the USER stops a SESSION or when the system automatically ends it due to inactivity.
- It represents a point in time, not a duration.

---

## SESSION TIME

**SESSION TIME** is the total duration of a completed SESSION.

- It is calculated as the difference between SESSION END TIME and SESSION START TIME.
- It includes all elapsed time, including periods of user inactivity.
- It is calculated using **seconds as the base unit**.

---

## TASK (Optional)

A **TASK** is an optional, free-text label associated with a SESSION.

- TASKS are descriptive only.
- TASKS have no structure or enforcement.
- TASKS do not affect session validity or time calculation.

---

## USER INACTIVITY

**USER INACTIVITY** is a continuous period during which no mouse or keyboard input
is detected globally (anywhere on the screen).

- It is measured only while a SESSION is active.
- Inactivity outside an active SESSION is not tracked.

---

## INACTIVITY DURATION

**INACTIVITY DURATION** is the length of continuous USER INACTIVITY.

- Any mouse or keyboard input resets the inactivity duration to zero.
- It is evaluated continuously while a SESSION is active.

---

## MAXIMUM INACTIVITY TIME

**MAXIMUM INACTIVITY TIME** is the upper limit of allowed continuous USER INACTIVITY
within an active SESSION.

For TimeTickIt:
- the maximum inactivity time is **5 minutes**.

When this limit is reached, the system automatically ends the SESSION.

---

## ACCUMULATED SESSION TIME (AST)

**ACCUMULATED SESSION TIME (AST)** is a derived value representing the sum of SESSION TIME
values across a defined set of completed SESSIONS.

- AST is calculated on demand.
- AST is not stored persistently.
- AST always has a defined scope.

---

## OUTPUT FILE

An **OUTPUT FILE** is a generated, read-only artifact created from completed SESSION data.

Output files do not modify underlying session data.

---

## OUTPUT PACKAGE

An **OUTPUT PACKAGE** is a ZIP archive generated by TimeTickIt that groups related
output files into a single distributable unit.

For TimeTickIt:
- an output package always contains exactly two files:
  - an invoice, and
  - an administrative record.
- the USER chooses where the output package is saved.
- the application does not transmit the output package.

---

## INVOICE

An **INVOICE** is an OUTPUT FILE intended for employer-facing use.

- It summarizes completed sessions and total billable time.
- It does not expose user inactivity details.
- It is generated in PDF format and is not encrypted.

---

## ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

An **ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD** is an OUTPUT FILE intended for internal verification
or dispute resolution.

- It reflects authoritative session data.
- It may include user inactivity duration and session end reasons.
- It is generated in PDF format and is **encrypted**.

---

## ENCRYPTED ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

An **ENCRYPTED ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD** is an administrative record protected using
password-based PDF encryption.

For TimeTickIt:
- the encryption password is **adminv1**.
- the purpose of encryption is access control, not high-security cryptography.

---

## Terminology Integrity Rule

- Definitions in this document are **stable and binding**.
- No document may redefine these terms.
- Code, tests, and outputs must conform exactly to these definitions.

If a term is not defined here, it must not be treated as a core concept.
