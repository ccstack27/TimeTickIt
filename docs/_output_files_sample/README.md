# Output Files Sample

This folder contains **reference samples** for files generated by TimeTickIt.

The documents here are **not generated automatically**.
They exist to define:
- structure
- wording
- visibility rules
- formatting expectations

All generated outputs must remain logically consistent with these samples.
